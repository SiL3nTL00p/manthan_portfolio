    description: "Accurately segmenting tumor regions from MRI scans to assist in automated diagnosis.",
    challenge: "Medical image segmentation is notoriously difficult due to low contrast and noise in MRI scans. Distinguishing between edema, enhancing tumor, and non-enhancing tumor regions required high pixel-level accuracy.",
    solution: "Implemented a modified U-Net Architecture with attention gates to focus on relevant spatial features. The pipeline included skull stripping, normalization, and a Dice Loss function to handle class imbalance.",
    impact: "Achieved a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 on the validation set, successfully segmenting core tumor regions in under 2 seconds per scan.",

    description: "An AI agent that quantifies resume quality based on job descriptions.",
    challenge: "Subjective hiring processes lead to bias and inefficiency. The goal was to build a system that could objectively parse and score technical resumes against specific job requirements.",
    solution: "Utilized BERT-based transformer models for semantic matching between candidate skills and job descriptions. Built a parsing engine to extract entities (Education, Skills, Experience) regardless of PDF formatting.",
    impact: "Reduced initial screening time by 40% in mock trials, providing instant feedback scores and keyword optimization suggestions to users.",

    description: "A RAG-based chatbot specializing in IIT Bombay related inquiries.",
    challenge: "General LLMs lack specific institutional context about IIT Bombay (deadlines, course codes, hostel rules). Students needed a unified interface for scattered institutional data.",
    solution: "Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We indexed institute wikis, rulebooks, and websites into a FAISS vector store, allowing the LLM to retrieve accurate, cited context before answering.",
    impact: "Deployed to a test group of 500+ students, successfully handling queries about academic calendars and mess menus with <5% hallucination rate.",

    description: "Deep Q-Learning agent designed for high-frequency trading simulations.",
    challenge: "Modeling market volatility is complex. Standard regression models fail to capture the sequential decision-making nature of trading where immediate actions affect future rewards.",
    solution: "Developed a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent. The model takes market state vectors (MACD, RSI, Price Action) as input and outputs discrete actions (Buy, Sell, Hold). Implemented Experience Replay to stabilize training.",
    impact: "Outperformed the baseline 'Buy and Hold' strategy by 15% in backtesting on historical NIFTY 50 data during high-volatility periods.",

    description: "Automated segmentation and classification of chromosome pairs.",
    challenge: "Manual karyotyping (pairing chromosomes) is tedious and error-prone for geneticists. Overlapping chromosomes in microscopy images make segmentation difficult.",
    solution: "Created a geometric separation algorithm using concave points to split touching chromosomes. Trained a CNN to classify isolated chromosomes into their respective pairs (1-22 + XY).",
    impact: "Automated the sorting process with 92% accuracy, significantly reducing the time required for genetic disorder screening.",
